## Winter of Code 3.0 ML Bootcamp <br/>
Hello,I am Mohd Rehan.Here I am working on my project for Winter of Code 3.0 ML Division. <br/>
I have implemented following machine learning algorithms as part of my project:

## 1) Linear regression
The main function is **Linear_regression** where the model is trained using input data.It returns the weight after training.
Using the weight matrix and the test data,values can be predicted.

Accuracy:23.99%.

I plotted a graph of cost vs number of iterations to visualise the reducing loss.

## 2) Logistic regression
